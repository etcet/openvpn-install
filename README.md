##openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for RHEL-based distros.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than one minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It isn't bulletproof but it has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation
EPEL should be installed first.

Run the script and follow the assistant.

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users.
